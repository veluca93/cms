        The properties we're referring to are the SQLAlchemy ones,
        specified as class-level attributes during class definition.
        They can be of two types: column or relationship properties
        (note that a relationship can also be created by a backref
        of another relationship property). For the purpose of this
        method the column properties that are part of a primary key
        or of a foreign key constraint are ignored.

        This constructor behaves like the following one (which uses
        Python 3 syntax, see [1][2][3] for additional information):

            obj = cls(<col props>, *, <rel props>)

        This means that the column properties can be specified both
        as positional and as keyword arguments while the relationship
        properties have to be given as keyword arguments. The order
        in which column properties appear as positional arguments is
        the order they were defined as class-attributes.

        All relationship properties are optional. Column properties
        are optional only if they're nullable or if they have a not
        null default value. The default value is the one specified
        in the Column() call used to define the property (None by
        default). This could cause us to violate a restriction that
        the Python syntax (see [2]) imposes on other functions: an
        argument without a default value may come after one with it.

        Additionally, this function also does some type-checking for
        column properties: a TypeError is raised if a given argument
        has a type that doesn't match the one of the corresponding
        property. Relationship properties aren't checked (for now).
